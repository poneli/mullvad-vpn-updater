# mullvad-vpn-upgrade
Upgrade script for mullvad-vpn application for Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/Fedora based systems.

Fetches latest version from https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases and compares version to currently installed version, will only download/install upgrade if latest version is newer then currently installed version.

Update downloadfolder="/change/me/example/directory" to the directory where you want packages temp stored and log files stored.

Run with sudo.

Cheers!
